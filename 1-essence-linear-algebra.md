# Vector

* **Definition**: Vector is a mathematical object that possesses both magnitude (size) and direction, often represented as an arrow with a defined length signifying its magnitude and the arrowhead indicating its direction

## Key points about vectors

* **Components**: A vector is usually expressed as a list of numbers (components) corresponding to its coordinates in a given space (e.g., a 2D vector might be written as (x, y)). 
* **Magnitude**: The length of the vector, calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in most cases. 
* **Direction**: The arrow's direction, determined by the relative values of its components.

## Linear Combinations, Span and Basic Vectors

* Linear combination of ```v``` and ```w``` can be represnted as ```av + bw``` where ```a``` and ```b``` are scalars.
* The span of ```v``` and ```w``` is the set of all their linear combonations.
* Example ```av + bw```, Let ```a and b``` vary over all real numbers.
* For Vector, think as a arrow. For Point, its a set of vectors

## What does the span of 3D vectors look like?
* Linear combination of ```v```, ```w``` and ```u``` can be represented as ```av + bw + uc``` where ```a```, ```b``` and ```c``` are scslars.
* Linearly dependent: ```u = av + bw```, for some values of ```a``` and ```b```
* Linearly independent: ```w != av``` or ```u != av + bw``` for all values of ```a``` and ```b```

## Technical Definition of Basis
* **Definition**: The basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space.

## Span
* **Definition**: The "span" of a set of vectors is the collection of all vectors that can be created by taking linear combinations of those vectors; essentially, it's the set of all possible vectors you can reach by adding scaled versions of the original vectors together.
